To whom it may concern:

Overview: The files in this folder are example pieces of a twitter feed.

Goal: The goal of this was to use Twitter's newest 1.1 API with OAuth to grab the latest tweets (whether text or pic) and post the 8 most recent. Wordpress Transient Caching is active so as to not bog down the website.

Technologies: The implementation is written with PHP and HTML
